Managing Digital Legacy (Crypto Edition)!
=========================================

I have been in crypto for a couple of years and for the longest time, I have not seen any company (or even anyone) that cares about **what will happen to their hard-earned crypto** when they're six feet under.
- can you request custodial wallets/exchanges to give your account access to your next-of-kin before you die?
- how can you pass your seed/secure phrases to your wife/husband/child/family when you are no longer alive?

I envision this document to be **THE** reference document for managing your digital legacy. Any information shared is NFA and searchable in the Internet (unless mentioned).
